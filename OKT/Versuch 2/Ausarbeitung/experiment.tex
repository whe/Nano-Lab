Before the tasks were performed the PIN diode was set into the test set-up. Therefore it was aligned into the optical path of the laser. To align the diode the laser was driven at a constant laser current. The position of diode was adjusted to maximize the photo current. 


Beside the laser light the diode detected extraneous light as well. This leads to an offset of the measured photo current. With the laser switched off a photo current varying between 2.2 and 2.4~$\upmu$A could be measured.

In this task the short-circuit current $I_{\mathrm{PIN}}$ of the PIN diode was measured for different laser currents. Figure \ref{fig:T1_setup}\footnotemark[1] shows the used setup. 

The laser current was swept from 0 to 65~mA. In the range from 0 to 10~mA a step size of the current change of 0.4~mA was used. From 10 to 20~mA the step size was 1~mA and from 20 to 60~mA a stepsize of 5~mA was used.

Figure \ref{fig:T1_laser} shows the measured short-circuit current $I_{\mathrm{PIN}}$ as a function of the laser current $I_{\mathrm{L}}$. The values of $I_{\mathrm{PIN}}$ are adjusted by 2.2~$\upmu$A. Thereby the value for the laser in off-state is 0~$\upmu$A.

\todo{Threshold}

For the next tasks four laser currents were selected. The corresponding photo currents are equidistant. Table \ref{tab:T1_values} shows the selected currents. Since the photo current is proportional to the incoming radiant power, the corresponding powers at the four laser currents are equidistant as well.

\section{Task 3: Field characteristic of an APD}

For this task a APD was integrated into the setup. The diode was aligned to maximize the output current $I_{\mathrm{APD}}$.
Figure \ref{fig:T3_setup}\footmarknote[1] shows the setup.

To measure the caracteristic of the laser diode a reverse voltage ov $U = -10$~V was applied to the APD and the series resistance $R_{\mathrm{V}}$. "The voltage corresponds to an avalanche multiplication factor $M_0 \approx 1$"\footmarknote[1].
