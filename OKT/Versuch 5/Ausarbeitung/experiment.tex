\section{Quadratic single-mode strip waveguide}
The next step was to simulate a three dimensional strip waveguide in air with a higth and a lenght of 0.356~$upmu$m and a core refractive index $n$~=~3.03 in air.
The lenght of the waveguide was 100~$\upmu$m.

Figure \ref{fig:2_index} shows the index profile of the waveguide.

\end{figure}

The excitation of the field is Gaussian and and has an offset in x direction by 0.25 times the width and in y direction by 0.25 times the hight of the waveguide.
For this waveguide all modes wer calculated at a frequency of 200~THz by using the correlation method and a grid size in x/y/z-direction of 0.02/0.02/0.05.

As figure \ref{fig:2_modes} shows only the ground modes TE00 and TM00 are guided. The field of TM01 \ref{fig:2_TE01} is not confined to the core and the calculated field makes no sense.
