\chapter{Experiment}

To analyze the properties of a ring resonator, a scaled microwave model is used. The setup is shown in Figure \ref{fig:setup}. The transmission throug this waveguide structure ($S_{21}$) is analyzed with a network analyser (NWA). For each measurement the NWA was calibrated without the resonator.

\chapter{Simulation}

In the next step a simulation with the program RSoft was performed. To reduce the computation time the 3D-structure was reduced to a 2D-structure using the effective index method. The simulation was performed in the optical frequency domain around 200~THz, so the dimensions of the waveguides had to be reduced by a factor of 20000. 

The strip waveguide with a length $l=5~\upmu$m was drawn in z-direction. For drawing the resonator rings two concentric cylinders with different diameters were created and subtracted from each other. The resulting index profile of the structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:index_profile1}.

In the first simulation a pulse was transmitted through the waveguide structure.
