\section{Loss Mechanisms in Optical Fibers}

The guiding mechanism of a mode in an optical fiber can be described by an electromagnetic wave model. A wave hitting a dielectic boundary at a certain angle is reflected completely. For a waveguide structure like shown in figure \ref{fig:slab1} the wave is confined to the core, when the incident angle $\theta$ is smaller than the angle of total reflection. But since the Fields in the waveguide propagate as waves an additional condition has to be fulfilled. The x component of the Fields has to be a standing wave, because else it would deplete itself. Thus the wavenumber in the core in x direction times the height of the core $k\i{1x}h$ plus the phase jump caused by the reflections on the boundarys has to be an integer multiple of $\pi$:
\begin{equation}
 -2k\i{1x}h+2\varphi = -m\cdot2\pi
\end{equation}
This leads to several guided modes in a waveguide structure, dependent on the height of the core and the used materials.
