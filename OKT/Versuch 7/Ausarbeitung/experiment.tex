In the Experiment an optical transmitter was simulated in OptSim. The Experiment was divided in three sub-projects.

\section{Project 1}
\label{sec:P1}

For the Experiment an OptiSim Example of a 50~\% RZ-OOK-Transmitter was used. Figure \ref{fig:P1_aufbau} shows the schematic of this example\footnotemark[3]. In the upper left-hand side theres the PRBS which generates a pseudo-random bit-stream. A logical connection path (green) leads to an NRZ-Rectifier (recnrz1) which generates an electrical output signal. Via an MZI this electrical NRZ-signal gets modulated on a 1550~nm laser. 

Starting in the upper left-hand side at the PRBS again, the lower path leads to an divider. Here the DataRate can be divided. In the first project there is no change of the data rate and the divider is 1. Afer that there is an amplifier (egain1) and a time-delay element. Those elements are used to set the driving-voltage for the MZM (PulseCarver).

For driving the MZ in "`puhs-pull"' mode (cf. \ref{sec:MZM}) the phase of one electrical paths is shifted. The folloing MZM (PulseCarver) is used to carve the NRZ pulses to a NRZ-OOK signal. \footnote[3]{Materials for the Preparation of Experiment 7: Simulation of Optical Transmitters}

Figure \ref{fig:P1ExB_Spectra} shows the spectrum of the laser source (red) and the spectrum of the optical NRZ signal (green). At a frequency of $f~\approx~193.415$~THz both spectra show a large peak. This is the laser frequency and therefor also the carrier frequency of the NRZ-Signal. 10~GHz beside the carrier frequency are the peaks of the 10~Gbit/s NRZ signal and it's harmonics.

Figure \ref{fig:P1ExB_Eye} shows an eye diagramm of the generated NRZ signal. 
\todo{Was bedeutet das? Was kann man hier sehen? WTF?} The measured log Q factor of the NRZ signal is 40 dB.

Figure \ref{fig:P1ExB_bit} shows the electrical , the optical NRZ  and the optical 50~\% RZ bit sequenze. Both optical sequences match the electrical signal. The RZ signal shows errorous pulsshape, because the exported data of this signal has not enough datapoints. Figure \ref{fig:P1ExB_FWHM} shows the correct shape of one pulse. In this figure also the full width at half maximum can be measured. With an FWHM of 0.05~ns and a lenght of a bitslot of 0.1~ns the duty cycle of the optical signal is 50~\%.

To design an optical transmitter outoput of 33~\% RZ OOK pulses the parameters of the optical tranmsmitter were changed. 
The operation of the pulse carver was change to carve the NRZ signal to a 33~\% RZ OOK signal. The driving voltage of the MZM needet to be changed. Therefore the Offset Voltage was set to 0~V. As in \ref{sec:RZ} the driving voltage needs to be doublet comparted to the 50~\% signal.To do this the gain (lin) (egain1) was set from 2.5 to 5.0. The driving frequency needed to be halved by setting the N-division factor (DataRate) to 2.
At least the phase of the driving signal was adapted by setting the time delay (3quarterT\_t) to 0,75/0,01 (ps).

The now generated signal shows pulses with a FWHM of 0.03~ns.



\section{Project 2}
In the next Project two PIN photodetectors were inserted. One at the exit of the NRZ-MZM and the other after the optical amplifier("`oampfg1"') for the RZ signal. To display the signal a "`Electrical Monitor"' was placed behind each of the detectors. After running the simulation the eye diagrams of each signal was recorded. \todo{Eye diagrams + Q-factor}







\section{Project 3}
\label{sec:P3}
In Project 3 an additional fibre was added to the simulation. The fibre "`CorningSMF28\_1550"' was inserted between the Pulse Carver and the in project 2 added PIN diode. 

For this project all nonlinear effects were deactivated ("`Advanced control"' -> all options were switched off).

To achieve an optical power of the fibre the optical power of the sender laser needed to be adjusted. Without adjusting the power, there is a power of -3.304 dBm after the 10~km fibre. Setting the CW-Power of the 1550~nm Laser to 3.304 dBm leads to an optical output power of 0 dBm after the 10~km optical fibre.
